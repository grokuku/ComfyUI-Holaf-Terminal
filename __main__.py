# === Holaf Terminal Password Utility ===
#
# This script is used to generate a secure password hash for use in config.ini.
# It uses PBKDF2 with a random salt, which is a strong, standard practice for
# password storage.
#
# HOW TO USE:
# 1. Navigate to your ComfyUI root directory in a terminal.
# 2. Make sure your Python virtual environment is activated.
# 3. Run the script using the following command:
#    python -m custom_nodes.ComfyUI-Holaf-Terminal
# 4. The script will securely prompt you to enter and confirm a password.
# 5. It will then print a hash string. Copy this entire string.
# 6. Paste it into your `config.ini` file under the [Security] section,
#    for the `password_hash` option.
#
# Example `config.ini` entry:
# [Security]
# password_hash = 6e36...a1c3$b5a7...d9f4
#
