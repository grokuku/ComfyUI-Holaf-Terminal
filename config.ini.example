# This is the configuration file for the Holaf Utilities extension.
# To use it, rename this file to "config.ini" in the same directory.

# --- Security Section (for Terminal) ---
#
# IMPORTANT: It is strongly recommended to set a password for the Terminal.
# If `password_hash` is empty or the [Security] section is missing,
# the terminal will be disabled as a security precaution and will prompt for setup.
#
# To generate a password hash:
# 1. Open a terminal/console.
# 2. Navigate to your main ComfyUI directory.
# 3. Activate the Python environment you use for ComfyUI.
# 4. Run the following command:
#    python -m custom_nodes.ComfyUI-Holaf-Utilities
# 5. Follow the prompts to enter and confirm your password.
# 6. Copy the generated hash and paste it below.
#
# Note: You can also set the password for the first time directly from the UI.

[Security]
# Example: password_hash = 6e36...a1c3$b5a7...d9f4
password_hash =
